Design patterns appear in everything. From houses, to microphones, to computers, all the way to websites and programs. At the same time, I find that design patterns can be everywhere, even without realizing they are being used. For example, in manufacturing, assembly line techniques often follow patterns similar to the factory pattern in software. Different stations handle specific tasks, and products move along the line as each station performs its function, resulting in efficient and standardized production. Design patterns will show up in many ways but the most common ones would be factory, singleton, observer, and Model-View-Controller (MVC). 

**Factory Pattern:** A creational design pattern where a factory method creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It provides a way to encapsulate the instantiation logic. Some advantages would be that it can return objects from different classes, return multiple objects, and can build additional, dependent objects. Disadvantages would be that it is more complicated than object oriented class constructor.

**Singleton Pattern:** A creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used to control access to resources such as database connections or logging instances. Advantages for this is that it provides a "global state" in an object oriented manner and that it is easy to implement lazy initialization. Some disadvantages are that it isn't normally thread-safe and that the global state isn't usually good. I have used this pattern to manage a centralized configuration object in a web application.

**Observer Pattern:** A behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is commonly used in event handling systems. Some advantages include allowing fo open-ended numbers of dependencies and that dependences can change at run-time. Some disadvantages are that if it is implemented badly, it can have performance issues, and that it can lead to race conditions in multi-threaded systems. I used this pattern to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects where one object notifies its dependents of state changes. This pattern was useful when implementing GUI components in a previous computer science class where I was making a website and another when I was making a simple game. 

**Model-View-Controller (MVC):** An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model (data and business logic), View (presentation layer), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly). It helps in achieving the separation of concerns and modularity in software design. Advantages for this is that it facilitates concurrent development by people with different skill sets, there is low coupling between components, and that a model can have multiple views. Disadvantages are the complexity and learning curve are steep. 

While these patterns are common, they are not the only solutions either. Some others would be the adapter pattern (which lets incompatible interfaces work together by providing a wrapper that converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects), factory pattern (which is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, allowing for flexibility in object creation), facade pattern (which provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its complexities from clients), and the state pattern (that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes). 

While learning about design patterns in software, I realized a lot of instances where I used them, yet did not realize it. For example, when handling user input, I separated the logic for processing user input from the code that is responsible for updating the display, which is an MVC pattern. Even in non-software applications do we follow them without noticing. For example project managers need to manage teams and workflows, so by using the observer pattern they would make updates spread to stakeholders, and team members acting as observers of project status changes. So to conclude, design patterns are not just restricted to software engineering but show up in all parts of our lives. Whether in architecture, project management, user interfaces, or household objects, design patterns serve as the base of engineering, which lets us systematically find good solutions for problems which often come up in our lives.
