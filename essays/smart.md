Engineers often will have issues that they won't know the answers to, thus asking questions in the best way makes it much easier to solve those problems. When someone runs into an issue with their code, it is often better to be concise and precise in what the problem is, as well as what it is that needs to be accomplished. For example, an example of a good question would include someone attempting to ask how to remove a specific value from an array, where they give an example as well as their constraints (being using "core Javascript" without using "frameworks").  This question is not only concise in stating their problem, but also clearly states what they need as well as what they cannot use. In total, the entire question is about 24 words while still stating exactly what they need. The question can be described as a good question based on the amount of people who upvoted their question. Moving forward, it would be good for someone such as myself to follow their example and explaining exactly what the symptoms/problem is as well as what it is I cannot use. 

In Eric Raymond's "How to ask questions the smart way," some of the points that are mentioned is "be precise and informative about your problem," "volume is not precision," "use meaningful, specific headers," and "describe your problem's symptoms, not your guesses." These points all apply to the previous example, however the bad example is as described next. Their header was "Run a scala code jar appear NoSuchMethodError:scala.Predef$.refArrayOps" which (at least to my knowledge) does not address any question, but it seems to be saying what they are trying to do. An issue that may not necessarily apply here is that they put a lot of code and logs which from what it looks like can be shortened or reduced, hence "volume is not precision" and "be precise and informative about your problem." It would have been better if they instead shortened their code to at most a dozen lines, and asked what they were trying to do as well as putting that in the header rather than their current one. A more knowledgeable software developer might understand much better than me, but at least from my perspective it seems like something I would ignore. This might also be reflected by the fact that it has hundreds of views, and only one solution was offered, and doesn't seem to be accepted. Something to learn from this would be to make sure the header includes the problem, reduce the amount of code included, and be precise in what the problem trying to be solved is. This will help the question to be acknowledged better, and also be easier for people to understand and answer it.
