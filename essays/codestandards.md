Why should we have standards when it comes to coding? Do they really help us as programmers to develop and create new code?

When I first started coding I thought things like python and C++ were confusing and hard to look at, and to be honest I still think so now. However, the difference between the me that started coding 7+ years ago versus me now is that (assuming it is a language I am familiar with or is similar to one I have used) I am able to see the code and have a decent idea of what is going on. Back then, I started out learning on what I think is both the dumbest and the best for early programmers, Scratch. The problem with this, is that I got too used to seeing blocks that whenever I saw a wall of text code, I would freeze up and not be able to think about what is happening. 

Eventually, I would actually go on to take a class (AP Computer Science Principles) to actually learn programming instead of trying to make terrible games, and in that class I learned to code in python. It was a very basic class, so really the majority of the time we spent it just learning concepts such as variables, for loops, etc. so I already had a decent idea of what was going on. The next class was in 2020, and we moved into AP Computer Science A where I would learn to code in Java (which helped since I ended up being a programmer as well as mechanical subteam member of my robotics team). 

So how does all of this information relate to coding standards? Well, in that class (as well as a few others I took down the line such as ICS 212) we actually learned coding the "proper way." We would learn to indent properly, put curly brackets on their own lines, put spaces in certain places, etc. These formatting practices helped to teach readability of my code, which in turn makes debugging millions of times easier.

Certain things could be argued against that though, particularly ESLint with IntelliJ is too overpowered in that it will suggest solutions to resolving warnings and errors with the lightbulb icon. This is something I do notice is very nice about IntelliJ, however being used to other IDEs balances that out and makes it an overall meh experience.

If there is anything more important than writing correct code, I would say it would be writing readable code. Down the line, being able to explain what code does so that someone else can improve on or work with your code can help with projects where more than one person is working on the same program. I might even argue that being able to make code that is easy to understand would have helped me all the way back to my Scratch days where sometimes I might even leave blocks on top of each other simply because it would "save space." Thus, coding standards overall are just better to have good practices with because it is more than just for the code.
