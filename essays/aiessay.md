### I. Introduction
  It isn't uncommon for many teachers to ban AI nowadays, as its capabilities have surpassed that of a good percentage of humanity. The use of AI, however, plays a crucial role in the future as it can improve the efficiency of us from being a useful tool in doing projects, diagnosing medical patients, and so much more. For me, AI such as ChatGPT has generally been primarily used for helping me to summarize long texts such as textbooks or research papers, and for ICS 314 specifically it was really only used to help me with simplifying code or diagnosing any errors I may have made. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
    I didn't really use it for WODs since if I ever ran out of time or had problems, I would simply just watch the video. The only times I have used it was for when I already finished a WOD but wanted to know how to do it in a different way by putting my code and asking how I would use Underscore for example.

  3. In-class Practice WODs
    I did not use AI for these as I always wanted to see how well I would perform with my own ability to see if I am able to figure out the problem later. I find that if I am prepared enough to do it without AI, I can make the time significantly faster using AI (though, I never ended up using AI on any of the WODs).

  4. In-class WODs
    I did not use AI for any of them since I either got them to work on my own, or I didn't get it at all. This is primarily due to me being prepared for the WOD so I am able to do it (or the reason I failed was for not submitting properly with the proper files or whatnot), or it was later on in the class and I wouldn't have gotten it with AI anyways. 
    
  5. Essays
    I did not use AI for any essays because I find that being good at writing is a good skill to practice and keep doing or else you lose it. I also just don't think the AI sounds human enough for me, and while my writing isn't great, it would only be useful in rephrasing/improving my writing, but usually I am too lazy to go through that.

  6. Final project
    I did not use AI for this as I have tried putting my files in but it spits out completely not working code with more errors than I started with.

  7. Learning a concept / tutorial
    I did use it to help me with learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I had prompted it "how does Javascript differ from Java" as I was already familiar with Java but Javascript was new to me and it explained what kinds of things Javascript had from the difference in purposes, some syntax differences like curly brackets and semicolons, all the way to concepts such as inheritance. I did similar things for HTML and CSS and they were generally the same responses in nature. This as a tool was really helpful to find where I should start in learning since I figured that most coding is relatively similar but there will be key differences which AI helps to point out early on.

  8. Answering a question in class or in Discord
    I did not use AI for these as unless I was told specifically to use AI to look something up, I never used it in class.

  9. Asking or answering a smart-question
    I did not use AI for this as I never used this channel.
    
  10. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
    I actually did use AI for this back when we were learning Underscore. I prompted it to translate a for loop to an Underscore function (I cannot find the actual prompts) but I remember it was able to to it correctly and I asked for it to be done with a different Underscore function and it did it again. It is really useful since I didn't know how to use Underscore at all, and the documentation is relatively hard to get a good idea of translating since the examples are usually really skin and bones types of examples which aren't as helpful as how AI translates it to be.

  11. Explaining code
    I did not use AI with this as if I needed an explanation of code, it usually would be available from the course site where they explain it, and if I were to explain my own code I don't need an AI to translate it as I usually know how my own code works since I wrote it all.

  12. Writing code
    I didn't use AI with writing my code (that I can remember without going through every single Experiences) except when I wanted to translate from a for loop to an Underscore code which I described previously.

  13. Documenting code
    I actually rarely documented code which is a bad habit but since I never really used AI then I never was required to document code. If I could go back and document my code I would probably just use AI to do it for me by submitting my code and asking for them to add comments to it.

  14. Quality assurance 
    I have used AI to diagnose some of my problems with code but it wasn't ever really in ICS 314 since the code was either simple enough and I would get it to work after a while or I would give it code and it would come out with more errors than I started with. I found that AI is generally difficult to use if you don't know what should be getting returned to you, so when I am not sure what my code should be doing it generally doesn't help for me to use AI unless I get lucky and it returns completely working code. The trouble was that if I didn't know how to do something, I would ask ChatGPT to do it for me in bulk rather than breaking down the code into smaller steps so it can get it all right. However, at least for the Project for example, I don't know where to start on the problem since it could be an issue with a file in one part such as in the ui, or an issue on a completely different part like the api, so it is usually not worth it to use in this way.

    N/A

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
  For me, I hardly use AI since I am not nearly as comfortable with using it as compared to using Google. With Google I am generally able to find answers relatively quickly and have a good confidence in the answers I come out with. For simpler things, I think that AI is really useful such as when it is something like asking "What is a pointer in C," however for more complex things which require multiple steps like to "evaluate this triple integral and then plug it in to a function," it will have a hard time with giving me a correct number. Similarly, if I were to ask it straight up a certain coding question, a lot of the time AI will either give you the correct code completely, or it will have an issue which would set you behind even more time to just find the issue and fix it.

### IV. Practical Applications:
  As I only use the old GPT, it isn't nearly as strong as I imagine it to be, however in the future I can see that it will be an incredibly useful tool which can enhance learning. In the same way that learning how to use Google in elementary school helped me to become a technology-aware person, I believe that learning to use AI at around that age can help students to become even more efficient with tasks in the future to where things like memorization becomes even less important and creative work becomes especially as important.
  Additionally, I think that jobs in the future will be dependent on AI or how efficient someone can be with using AI, so learning how to get results that I can be confident in from these AI engines will likely benefit me in the future. As companies continue to come out and say things like "AI will replace coders/CS majors" I think that being able to use AI will be more and more of a green flag so to speak. People are always afraid of technology replacing humans in jobs and that AI will take over the world, but I think we shouldn't be too afraid and stifle our growth out of fear.
  Lastly, I think that it is a well known fact that AI can be applied to many various situations. From medical applications like machine learning based diagnosis, to engineering applications such as designs and calculations, all the way to even content creation such as artists or video makers, AI has potential (or has already begun) to surpass humans in many aspects of these things. It isn't that interesting to explain since it is all the talk from everyone nowadays, but from a future engineer's perspective I am excited to think of the new jobs that will come out of AI and to see how useful it might be to advance humanity. When it comes to technology, humans have advanced extremely fast over the past decade so it will be interesting to see if an ultra-realistic virtual reality device is introduced or even a new programming AI that surpasses even the best humans at coding.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
  I have trouble with using AI when it comes to being confident that what I am being told is true. As I have often had instances of getting an output that was simply completely wrong, my confidence in AI is low whereas my confidence in myself is higher, and if I am the one who gets it wrong then I only have myself to blame rather than blaming AI for giving me wrong advice. I think the current level of using AI is quite nice, especially as I don't feel as guilty by using it in this class as it is generally encouraged in comparison to other classes which explicitly condemn it and even threaten to fail you for being caught using it. Overall, I think that it is quite good that it is encouraged as it seems that the future will require using AI, and AI isn't really all that perfect currently to find it that dangerous to use as long as it isn't blindly trusted.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
  I found that being encouraged to use AI actually made myself feel a lot less restricted in doing work. Especially since a lot of times I have a hard time thinking of ideas and just found myself asking ChatGPT for something to start off with, but in this class since it is encouraged I surprisingly found myself actually using AI less to start with something. Rather than needing a starting place, I would simply ask it to help me with formulating ideas following the main ones I thought up. Instead of needing to create the overall scheme, I simply needed AI to generate a skeleton and then I built the rest around it. This actually helped me to enhance my work by giving me time to fine-tune things rather than to have to stress about everything. Comparatively, when not using AI my work tended to take longer as I would struggle to build off of my ideas, thus resulting in me sometimes just completely making a new idea in hopes of finding one with topics easier to think of. I would need to spend much more time in building the framework rather than fixing the small stuff.

### VII. Future Considerations:
  As I mentioned in section IV, I believe that if it is integrated properly, it can raise a very efficient generation of coders which can get much more done. While current coders are likely very fast with languages they are very familiar with, I think that AI can either make it to where knowing all the languages is possible, or maybe even completely replacing the need for certain languages since the human could just learn to prompt well and the AI will have the code working on its own. This is still a far cry from the current level of AI as making large codes becomes less and less likely to be returned as working, however, I think that as AI is improved, the ease on programmers will improve exponentially. 

### VIII. Conclusion:
  To conclude, I find the future of AI to be extremely promising as it can enhance students' learning as well as professionals' efficiency. As it requires you to have a decent understanding of the subjects, it is currently not at the stage where it can be fully relied on, however it is definitely not far away from a time where humans can find jobs in more creative work rather than for example call center workers or cashiers. For the use of AI in specifically engineering classes, I think that AI is a very useful tool which should not be entirely denied especially as there is a valid argument that a good engineer should know how to use AI in the future. As a recommendation for integrating AI better, it would probably be useful to learn how to break down problems which can be solved by AI at a high probability such as in a flow chart of levels of abstraction (i.e. to implement a button: ask code for a button --> ask how to implement it into a page --> ask how to add/link that page to the website).
