For some people, honestly myself included, the reason for taking this class was just to fulfill a requirement towards a degree in engineering or computer science. But, somehow this class became a big part of my career as it has taught me many things from the nitty-gritty parts of basic web development, all the way to some of the big picture things such as design patterns. It is important for one to recognize what goes beyond the class such as learning about how coding standards, UI frameworks, and ethics in software engineering. 

**Coding Standards**
A coding standard is a rule or system which is used by developers, and in particular when writing code. Outside of web development, having coding standards is important as basic concepts such as using CamelCase when making variables could be considered a coding standard. Having rules or conventions when doing any task will help to make working more efficient or readable down the line. For example, if someone was developing an algorithm for an AI, it would be important to use conventions which make it easier to diagnose what issues could be down the line as this will save time and resources. 

**UI Frameworks**
A UI framework is a set of classes and interfaces that define the elements and behavior of a window-based UI Subsystem. While this definition definitely makes it seem like it would only really be applicable to web development, UI frameworks can still be used outside of those applications. For example, the Underscore library provides dozens of functions which essentially replace things such as for loops and whatnot. While it does have a pre-made algorithm to do things, it possibly could be less efficient than if you were to just directly use a for loop or while loop, but it can make code much more readable and easy to diagnose issues. Overall, UI frameworks are especially useful as an extra tool in the repertoire since having alternatives can go a long way.

**Ethics In Engineering**
Probably the most obvious topic which can be applied outside of web applications, but ethics in engineering are something which will come up almost for sure in anyone's career. It is important to at least have an understanding of the ethics for engineers, which are generally made by a group of professionals. In particular, the IEEE ethics are as follows:
1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
These standards provide a guiding arrow for engineers and it is important to keep them in mind when faced with decisions. If someone were faced with a moral dilemma which forced them to choose to either develop a product that might be unsafe, but their employer was forcing them to make a change which would result in higher profits, it would be wise to refer to the ethics and follow some sort of framework (in this case probably from a utilitarian perspective) in order to make the best possible decision.

As such, these topics are only a few which I have had the benefit of learning in this class. Many other tools such as learning new coding languages (Javascript, HTML, CSS), GitHub for groups, and even LinkedIn have been an extremely interesting thing to have come from software engineering. It was very interesting to have the use of AI available as it seems to be something which will be integrated into engineering careers in the future, but as of right now it is not something I have relied on for assignments including this one. What started off as just a class towards a degree became one which I find to have had an extremely significant impact on myself as an engineer as it has taught skills such as UI frameworks and coding standards that go beyond just web development.
