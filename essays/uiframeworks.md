If I were back in FIRST Robotics and the only way I knew how to put together two pieces of metal was by welding, I would be severely limited in what I could do. Thus, adding more tools to the repertoire would greatly benefit me by allowing me to use things such as brackets, zip screws, or rivets. Similarly with UI Frameworks, it might be possible to implement the same things through other methods, but a good software developer becomes an even better software developer if they have more than one angle that they could solve a problem.

So, why should we learn to use UI Frameworks if it can be complicated? Having different solutions to solve a problem makes a person versatile. Being flexible improves your value since some solutions might get the job done, but there might exist a solution that is even better. Going back to the robotics example, if someone wanted me to build a drivetrain but a certain part would be better if it were modular (maybe if it were to give more space to access a different part), our solution of welding would be very bad in this situation as welding is permanent. Thus, being able to use a different solution to join it together such as using angle brackets and zip screws would allow us to achieve modularity. With UI frameworks such as Bootstrap, we can use things like the icons which are built in rather than having to do something like maybe needing an image file to use the icon.

The return for learning how to use things like UI Frameworks is that it makes the developer more versatile in their skill set. Being adaptable makes them more attractive to people who might want to recruit others to their team, which would in turn give that developer more opportunities. In my experience in robotics, we needed to choose members for our team, and what I found myself looking at most was how well the person was able to solve problems in different ways since it would often mean they were faster workers and more efficient with their time. It would not surprise me if someone who were recruiting for a company would look for similar traits, among others, in applicants. 

To conclude, why should we learn to use UI Frameworks if they can be complicated and take a long time to master? The answer is because having an uncapped skill set can make a developer more attractive to people who might be searching for members. This would give them more opportunities in the future, which, in my opinion is always a good thing.
