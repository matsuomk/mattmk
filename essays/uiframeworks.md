Thus, adding more tools to the repertoire would greatly benefit me by allowing me to use things such as brackets, zip screws, or rivets. Similarly with UI Frameworks, it might be possible to implement the same things through other methods, but a good software developer becomes an even better software developer if they have more than one angle that they could solve a problem. 

Being versatile improves your value since some solutions might get the job done, but there might exist a solution that is even better. Going back to the robotics example, if someone wanted me to build a drivetrain, but a certain part would be better if it were modular (maybe we want to be able to take off a plate easily to access a different part), our solution of welding would be very bad in this situation as it would
