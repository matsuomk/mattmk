The project my group worked on is Clubs at Manoa. The goal is to make a site which can allow students to access clubs and groups registered with UH with a more visually appealing way. Since the current UH site is simply a big spreadsheet of words, adding images and suggestions will help to allow students to find where they can fit in. Some things I worked on in particular were planning of the application as well as some initial developments and implementations. From this experience, I learned that it is difficult to manage time and find times that match up with group members. It was also a good learning experience for seeing the planning of a project and that it is difficult to keep up with deadlines as scheduling conflicts are especially bound to happen. It was my first time learning to use GitHub with multiple people and not just myself adding to my own repository, so it was a good learning experience to see how merges and whatnot work in projects.
