I was a Teaching Assistant at UH Manoa for EE160 during Fall 2023 and am currently a TA for EE160 again for 2 sections this semester (Spring 2024). As a TA, I run labs, which consists of helping students with their python homework. Occasionally, I will do lectures instead of the professor when he is busy, but it happened only a few times.

I learned a lot about python as I almost never used it aside from for in AP Computer Science Principles class in high school. It was also a good experience to lecture as if I wanted to work for a university as a researcher, I would probably have to teach a few classes and might be in a large lecture hall like this class was. I also learned to teach smaller classes when we do labs as it is a smaller group.
